### Welcome ğŸ‘‹
I'm a Dev/Sys Admin/Devops person living and working in Halifax/NS.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VFIO pcie passthrough for virtual machines.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Arch Linux
After 20 years of Debian it's time to try some of the new things around I guess.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on most things open source
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: here on github
- âš¡ Fun fact: Debian is still my favorite distro.
